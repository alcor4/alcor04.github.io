### <a id="alwire">Aluminium Wire</a>

Bare Aluminium Wire of diameter as per customer specification. <br/>

## <a id="about"><center>About Us</center></a>

Our firm was eastblished in 1973 by Mr. GC Jain, engineering graduate in metallurgy from Government College of Engineering Raipur.<br/>
We started commercial production in 1976 with AAC conductor. ACSR conductor was added later in the year. We got BIS standard marking licence in the year 1978. Subsequently production of AAAC conductor was started in 1999.<br/>
We currently manufacture and market ACSR, AAC & AAAC conductors and Aluminium Wire under our brand name 'ALCOR'.<br/>
Our manufacturing plant is located at Rajnandgaon district, Chhattisgarh. Our location is in close proximity to raw material suppliers and centrally located in the country.<br/>

## <a id="qc"><center>Quality & Certification</center></a>

We are enrooted to our guiding principle Manufacturing quality products to customer satisfaction. Strict control is exercised over procurement (incoming raw material testing), in process testing, packaging and other ancillary process. To facilitate confirmity to standards we have in house quality control and testing lab which is fully equipped with regular calibration of instruments.<br/>
We have Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) standard marking licence for IS:398 Part 2 (ACSR) since 1978. Conductor manufactured by us has been tested by independent agencies and at independent labs like CMPDIL, RITES, TAG Corporation, QMTL CSIDC, QMTL MPLUNL, NSIC TSC, CSPDCL Testing Lab etc.<br/>
